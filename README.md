 LocalDevVPN is a developer tool for creating and managing local network tunnels directly on iOS. It gives you a secure, isolated virtual interface for testing and debugging without sending traffic to external servers.

  Key Features:

  - Local network tunneling: spin up a dedicated virtual interface for development and testing
  - Custom network configuration: set device IP, tunnel IP, and subnet mask
  - One-touch connection: quick connect/disconnect with clear status
  - Auto-connect: optionally start the tunnel when the app launches
  - Connection monitoring: track connection time and live status
  - Comprehensive logging: review detailed connection logs for troubleshooting

  Ideal for developers, network engineers, and testers who need precise control over a local network environment. All traffic stays on-device with no data collection or external
  connections. 
  Requires iOS 14.0 or later.
